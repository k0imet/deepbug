# Deepug

DeepBug is an automated reconnaissance and bug bounty hunting platform designed to streamline your workflow. It integrates various open-source tools to perform subdomain enumeration, port scanning, JavaScript analysis, vulnerability scanning, and more, all managed within a user-friendly interface.
## Get Started:

    üìÇ Projects: Start by creating a new project or loading an existing one. All your scan results and findings will be saved under the active project.
    üîç Reconnaissance: Dive into discovery! Run subdomain scans, active host verification, port scans, and JavaScript analysis.
    üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Scan: Once you have your targets, launch vulnerability scans using integrated tools like Nuclei.
    üìä Dashboard & üìÑ Reporting: Review your findings, track progress, and generate comprehensive reports.


## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Operating System**: Linux or macOS (some tools like Subfinder may require specific dependencies)
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **External Tools**: Subfinder, Amass, DNSx, HTTPx, Nmap, Masscan, Fakjs, Webanalyze, Paramspider, GF (ensure these are installed and accessible in your PATH)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/deepug.git
   cd deepug
   ```
2. **Install requirements.txt**

   Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:
   ```text
   streamlit
   pandas
   plotly
   pyyaml
   ```

4. **Install External Tools**:
   Install the required reconnaissance tools. For example:
  ```bash
bash install.sh
   ```

   Ensure go tools are in your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
   ```

5. **Configure the Application**:
   Create or edit `config.yaml` in the root directory with necessary settings (e.g., paths to tools, project directory):
   ```yaml
   projects_dir: projects
   tools:
     subfinder: subfinder
     amass: amass
     dnsx: dnsx
     httpx: httpx
     nmap: nmap
     masscan: masscan
     fakjs: fakjs
     webanalyze: webanalyze
     paramspider: paramspider
     gf: gf
   ```

6. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (default Streamlit port).
   - The app opens on the **Projects** page (`0_Projects.py`).

2. **Create or Select a Project**:
   - On the **Projects** page, create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Projects are stored in the `projects/` directory, with results organized by target (e.g., `projects/MTN/mtn_com/`).

3. **Run Reconnaissance Scans**:
   - Navigate to the **Reconnaissance Tools** page (`1_Reconnaissance.py`).
   - Select or enter a target domain (e.g., `mtn.com`).
   - Use the tabs to run:
     - **Subdomain & Takeover Scan**: Discover subdomains and check for takeovers.
     - **Port Scanning**: Scan for open ports using Nmap or Masscan.
     - **JavaScript Analysis**: Extract JS files and endpoints.
     - **Technology Detection**: Identify web technologies with Webanalyze.
     - **Vulnerability Detection**: Scan for vulnerabilities using Paramspider and GF.
   - Scans run synchronously, displaying progress and results in real-time.

4. **View Results in the Dashboard**:
   - Go to the **Dashboard** page (`2_Dashboard.py`) to view:
     - **Key Metrics**: Counts of subdomains, open ports, JS files, vulnerabilities, and takeovers.
     - **Visualizations**: Bar chart for scan result distribution and pie chart for vulnerability severity.
     - **Target Overview**: Summary of results per target.
     - **Detailed Results**: Expandable sections for each scan type and target.
   - Click **Refresh Dashboard** to update results after new scans.

5. **Run Vulnerability Scans**:
   - Use the **Vulnerability Scanner** page (`3_Scanner.py`) for additional vulnerability scans (if implemented with backgrounding, results may appear in the dashboard).

## Example Workflow

1. Create a project named `example.com` on the **Projects** page.
2. On the **Recon** page, enter `example.com` as the target.
3. Run a **Subdomain & Takeover Scan** to discover subdomains and live hosts.
4. Run a **JavaScript Analysis** to extract JS files and endpoints.
5. Run a ***
6. Navigate to the **Dashboard** to view metrics and visualizations for `example.com`.
